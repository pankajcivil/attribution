# Attribution script and data

A package used for attribution on climate change. 
Two methods are available: Ordinary Least Squares
(OLS) and the new Ribes et al. (2017) that considers
both observational and model error to estimate the covariance
matrices.

This package was used in the following paper that is currently under 
review: Abreu, R. C., Tett, S. F. B., Schurer A., Rocha, H. R. 
(2019) Attribution of detected temperature trends in Southeast Brazil,
*Geophysical Research Letters*.

For the preprocessing steps the script depends heavily on Scilab code 
developed by Aurélien Ribes, in the following paper that should also
be referenced if this code is used: Ribes, A., Planton, S., & Terray, L. 
(2013). Application of regularised optimal fingerprinting to attribution. 
Part I: method, properties and idealised analysis. *Climate dynamics*, 
41 (11-12), 2817–2836.
